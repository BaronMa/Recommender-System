# Recommender-System
A project about building a recommender system with a collection called MovieLens. <br>
The MovieLens dataset contains usersâ€™ movie ratings and is popular for implementing and testing recommender systems. The specific dataset I used for this project was MovieLens 100K Dataset which contained 100,000 movie ratings from 943 users and a selection of 1682 movies. <br>
The whole project includes **data manipulation** for the MovieLens data, baseline recommendation algorithms consisting of **average user rating**, **most popularity items**, user-user and item-item based collaborative filtering for **cosine, euclidean similarity measurement** and **Probabilistic Matrix Factorization(PMF)**. All these recommenders are evaluated by cross validation based on RMSE and ranking metrics.
